    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="legal-date">Effective: February 12, 2026</div>

    <p>Welcome to Accruu. By accessing or using the Accruu mobile application and website (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Overview of the Service</h2>
    <p>Accruu is a technology platform that monitors your device screen time and facilitates micro-investments through a third-party brokerage partner. Accruu is not a broker-dealer, investment advisor, or financial institution. We do not provide investment advice, tax advice, or financial planning services.</p>
    <p>Brokerage services, including account custody, trade execution, and regulatory compliance (KYC/AML), are provided by Alpaca Securities LLC, a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA and SIPC. Your brokerage account is held at Alpaca Securities LLC, not at Accruu.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years of age and a legal resident of the United States to use Accruu. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To use certain features of the Service, you must create an account and provide accurate, complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

    <h2>4. Investment Risks</h2>
    <p><strong>Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.</strong> The value of your investments can go up or down. Past performance does not guarantee future results. ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments.</p>
    <p>Accruu does not guarantee any investment returns. The investment amounts triggered by screen time interventions are determined by your settings and may result in losses. You should only invest amounts you can afford to lose.</p>
    <p>Securities offered through Alpaca Securities LLC are not FDIC insured, have no bank guarantee, and may lose value.</p>

    <h2>5. Not Investment Advice</h2>
    <p>Accruu presents a curated selection of ETFs for your consideration. This selection does not constitute a recommendation, solicitation, or offer to buy or sell any security. The information provided through the Service is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized investment advice.</p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for your investment decisions. We strongly encourage you to consult with a qualified financial advisor before making investment decisions.</p>

    <h2>6. Screen Time Monitoring</h2>
    <p>Accruu uses your device's native screen time APIs to monitor usage. By using the Service, you grant Accruu permission to access aggregate screen time data on your device. You may revoke this permission at any time through your device settings, which may limit the functionality of the Service.</p>

    <h2>7. Fees</h2>
    <p>Accruu currently does not charge fees for use of the platform. We reserve the right to introduce fees in the future with reasonable advance notice. Alpaca Securities LLC may charge fees related to brokerage services, which are governed by your agreement with Alpaca.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service, including all content, features, and functionality, is owned by Accruu LLC and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Service without our express written permission.</p>

    <h2>9. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure</li>
      <li>Use automated systems to access the Service without our permission</li>
      <li>Impersonate any person or entity</li>
      <li>Manipulate or attempt to manipulate screen time data to trigger or avoid investments fraudulently</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Accruu LLC shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or investment value, arising out of or related to your use of the Service.</p>
    <p>Accruu is not responsible for the actions, omissions, or policies of Alpaca Securities LLC or any other third-party service provider.</p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time for any reason, including violation of these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. Your brokerage account with Alpaca Securities LLC is separate and is governed by your agreement with Alpaca.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Texas.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated through the app or by email. Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>

    <h2>15. Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about these Terms should be directed to:</p>
