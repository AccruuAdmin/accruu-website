    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="legal-date">Effective: February 12, 2026</div>

    <p>Accruu LLC ("Accruu," "we," "us," or "our") operates the Accruu mobile application. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our app and services.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and other information required for brokerage account creation. Identity verification (KYC) information such as Social Security number, date of birth, and address is collected by our brokerage partner Alpaca Securities LLC and is not stored by Accruu.</p>
    <p><strong>Screen Time Data:</strong> Accruu monitors your device screen time usage using native operating system APIs (iOS Screen Time API and Android Digital Wellbeing API). This data is processed locally on your device. We collect only aggregate screen time totals (e.g., "2 hours 15 minutes today") to determine when intervention thresholds are met. We do not collect, transmit, or store information about which specific apps you use or what content you view.</p>
    <p><strong>Investment Data:</strong> We store records of your investment transactions, including ETF symbols, investment amounts, timestamps, and order identifiers. This data is necessary to display your portfolio and transaction history.</p>
    <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect basic device information such as device type, operating system version, and app version for troubleshooting and performance monitoring purposes.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain the Accruu application and its features</li>
      <li>Facilitate brokerage account creation and investment transactions through Alpaca Securities LLC</li>
      <li>Monitor screen time to trigger investment interventions based on your preferences</li>
      <li>Display your investment portfolio, transaction history, and progress toward goals</li>
      <li>Communicate with you about your account, service updates, and support</li>
      <li>Improve our services and develop new features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p><strong>Alpaca Securities LLC:</strong> We share necessary information with our brokerage partner to facilitate account creation, trade execution, and regulatory compliance. Alpaca Securities LLC is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA and SIPC. Their use of your information is governed by their own privacy policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for infrastructure hosting. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.</p>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We do not share your screen time data with any third party.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All data transmitted between the app and our servers is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher</li>
      <li>Data stored in our databases is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption</li>
      <li>Sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens) are stored in AWS Secrets Manager, not in application code</li>
      <li>Bank account credentials are never transmitted to or stored by Accruu — these are handled exclusively by our regulated financial partners</li>
      <li>Access to production systems is restricted using role-based access controls</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your account information and transaction history for as long as your account is active and as required by applicable financial regulations. Screen time data processed on-device is not retained by Accruu's servers. If you request account deletion, we will remove your personal information within 30 days, subject to any legal or regulatory retention requirements.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal information we hold about you</li>
      <li>Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your personal information</li>
      <li>Opt out of certain data processing activities</li>
      <li>Receive a copy of your data in a portable format</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Accruu is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover that we have collected information from a child under 18, we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy in the app and updating the effective date above. Your continued use of Accruu after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
